I have worked on real time data, data science EDA and algorithms during my academic. Stock market price prediction is one among them for my capstone project.

Problem Statement:

Techniques Used:
Linear Regression, Decision Trees, ARIMA and LSTM

Role:
Understanding the business problem and acquiring knowledge about each attribute in the dataset. Cleaning data, profiling of each variable to impute missing values where required.

Outcome:
Built various models, Predicted Closing price of the stock and Created interactive dashboard and visualized using Tableau to make investors buy/sell Decisions
